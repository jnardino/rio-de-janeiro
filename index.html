                <h4>Why Rio de Janeiro?</h4>
                <h2>Land of Samba and natural beauty</h2>
                <p>
                    Rio de Janeiro never fails to impress us with its modern outlook that 
                    reflects its progression through the times of yore. The historic sites, sparkling beaches, 
                    green belts and cheerful attitude of the locals attract tourists where heaven meets earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rain-forests, museums, beaches gardens and the glitz of the city have made Rio what it 
                    is today - Brazil's top-notch tourist destination.
